# Invisible Cloak using OpenCV ðŸ§¥

This project demonstrates the creation of an "invisible cloak" effect using OpenCV. The program captures the background of a scene, detects a specific color (e.g., blue), and replaces the detected color with the background to simulate invisibility.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2` library)
- Numpy
